        <p>
          When you are heading out to protest, you are exercising your rights to free speech and peaceful protest.
          Though you may set out with preset expectations, keep in mind that this may not be the reality you face. We
          have all witnessed peaceful demonstrations turn into violent displays of aggression from police and military
          forces, as well as protesters. Emotions may reach their heights, cool heads may be lost, and tempers may
          flare. In the heat of the moment, be sure to keep these points in mind.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Protect Your Mind, Guard Your Heart</h2>
        <p>
          You&rsquo;re protesting to show your support, but you may also be dealing with emotions, hurt, pain, or loss.
          There are many reasons that people have come together to raise their voices. During the protest, be sure to
          take care of yourself. If you find yourself getting overwhelmed, step back, take a deep breath, and focus on
          your mental health. Take the time you need to deal with your emotions properly. If you know the moment may be
          too much to handle, bring a friend or family member with you. It&rsquo;s best to have a support system to help
          you through these times.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Go for the Right Reasons</h2>
        <p>
          We have all seen it. Some are only out there to get a second of social media fame or look good for the Gram.
          The media also chooses to highlight some who are focused on looting, not the message. Don&rsquo;t find
          yourself in one of those categories. There is too much at stake for us to lose sight of the goal. Stay true to
          your mission and make sure your protest cannot be misconstrued or misinterpreted. Make your goal loud and
          clear!
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Stay Vigilant</h2>
        <p>
          The situation around you may suddenly shift. There are crowds of people and the potential for chaos and
          danger. Though we are assembling in the name of peace and unity, it is always best to be prepared for a turn.
          Ensure you keep a close watch of the environment and keep yourself out of situations that may be harmful to
          you or others. Keep in mind; there have been many confirmed reports of undercover cops who are looking to make
          arrests for unsuspecting protesters. Keep this in mind and do not fall victim to this tactic.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Encountering Law Enforcement</h2>
        <p>
          As we have seen on TV, there may be a time where protesters and police are in a standoff. These encounters
          have typically been met with non-lethal force, which includes tear gas and rubber bullets. These tactics have
          been promoted and encouraged by our nation&rsquo;s leadership, so do not think that your local police force is
          incapable of such actions. In the case that gas is used to disperse crowds, cover your face and eyes and
          quickly, but safely, move outside of the radius of the gas. If you wear contact lenses, this may be a good day
          to leave those at home and wear your glasses, as the gas can potentially get trapped under the lenses and
          cause further damage. Bringing extra water may come in handy if you are exposed to the gas, as you can rinse
          out your eyes and mouth. When dealing with police who are increasingly physical with crowds, remember that if
          you are a person of color, this could be dangerous. Be aware of the risks and study up on the tactics used by
          police. Plan to avoid situations that you are not comfortable in and know how to handle police tactics.
